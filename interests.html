            <p>I'm an avid artist, who has actively started drawing traditionally on January 1st, 2025! I have drawn before 2025, but I only really tried learning at the start of 2025. I have drawn every single day since, and am currently on about day 280 of my daily drawing streak as of righting this! I also know how to do pixel art and have been creating pixel art for a couple years!</p>
