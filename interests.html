        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Other than coding and computer science, I have numerous other hobbies that I spend a majority of my time on. Here are some of them that are outside of school!</p>
        <article>
            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>I'm an avid artist, who has actively started drawing traditionally on January 1st, 2025! I have drawn before 2025, but I only really tried learning at the start of 2025. I have drawn every single day since, and am currently on about day 280 of my daily drawing streak as of righting this! I also know how to do pixel art and have been creating pixel art for a couple years!</p>
            <p><b>Drawing Methods I Know:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional</li>
                <li>Digital</li>
                <li>Pixel</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Wbat I Love About Drawing:</b> It is an amazing tool for expressing yourself, creativity, and it is very challenging, and I love a good challenge! It is also important for methods of creative expression to be perserved, especially in this time where ai is getting exponentially better at creating ai art.</p>

            <h3>Anime</h3>
            <p>
            <img src="images/image of my mal stats.png" alt="A screenshot of my MyAnimeList statistics" height="250">
            </p>
            <p>I have been watching anime for about 5 years at this point! This is an actual image of my statistics on the anime logging website named MyAnimeList, about 600 animes and 250 mangas, and that is only the things that I have logged! For a total of 200+ days, or about 5000 hours, all on one hobby!</p>
            <p><b>My Anime Related Hobbies:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Watching Anime</li>
                <li>Reading Manga</li>
                <li>Watching Vtubers</li>
                <li>Playing Anime games</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How Anime Has Helped Me:</b> I honestly have learned a ton about creating stories, writing, art, and animation from consuming all of this content. This is also one of the biggest things that has motivated me to learn drawing! It is also motivation to learn another language! So, anime has motivated and inspired me to do a lot of different things!</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>
            <img src="images/osu logo.png" alt="The logo of the rhythm game Osu!" height="250">
            </p>
            <p>I play a ton of different games, none of which are really the popular genres or games like Fortnite, Roblox, etc. I absolutely <strong>love</strong> rhythm games like Osu!, specifically the gamemode called mania, which is a VSRG (vertical scrolling rhythm game) and the game Geometry Dash. For tower defense games, obviously the famous one BTD6 (Bloons Tower Defense 6) and another called Battle Cats. I have about 900 hours on Geometry Dash, 400 on BTD6, 600 on Battle Cats, and a few hundred spread throughout multiple different VSRG games. I love JRPG style games like Paper Lily, Undertale, Deltarune, Omori, One Shot, and more! I also love some other games like Celeste, and visual novel games like DDLC (Doki Doki Literature Club!).</p>
            <p><b>Some of my Favorite Game Genres:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rhythm Games</li>
                <li>Tower Defense Games</li>
                <li>JRPG Games</li>
                <li>Visual Novels</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How These Games Help Me:</b> Games like these are the main reason I wanted to learn programming, so that I can be able to create and share my own games for others to have fun playing! They are also a smaller part of why I wanted to learn art, so that I can create art for any potential games I make. The games I play are rather unique as well, Rhythm games help with hand-eye cordination and reaction speed, tower defense games help with strategic thinking and planning, JRPG games and Visual Novels are both very story and text heavy, especially Visual Novels.</p>

            <h3>How My Interests Connect to Computer Science</h3>
            <p>Art, anime, and gaming are all connected to Computer Science to me in one way or another. Art is something I wanted to learn partially because I wanted to be able to create my own art for video games I would want to make. Anime helped me learn story-telling skills so if I created a more story based game I could do it better and was a partial reason to want to learn Computer Science. Games are the biggest motivator to learn how to program as I was inspired to want to be able to create my own games as well!</p>
